Example
==================================================

This folder contains an example spec file.

In order to see all behaviors of RSpec Fixtures, we need to invalidate
the fixtures, so for convenience, you can run:

    $ run example

from the root folder of this repository, to reset fixtures and run the
spec file interactively.
